					<h1>Cincinnati Chili</h1>
					<p>
						Depending on where you were raised, your definition of "chili" may be much different
						from someone else's.  The first time I ever had Cincinnati Chili, I thought there was something
						wrong.  Chili is never supposed to be served over noodles or baked potatoes.  Chili is a meal on
						its own.  Put some in a bowl, grab a spoon, and enjoy.  But Cincinnati chili seemed more like
						a meat sauce than a chili.  And the taste was very different, what with hints of cocoa and cinnamon.
						But I quickly warmed up to this local favorite.  "True" chili will
						always need to resemble the thicker dish I enjoyed as a child, but I have made room in my heart (and on 
						my noodles), for Cincinnati Chili.

				<div id="accompaniments">
					<h2>Accompaniments</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>1 pound spaghetti, cooked, drained, and tossed with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
						<li>12 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
						<li>1 can red kidney beans (15-ounce), drained, rinsed, and warmed</li>
						<li>1 medium white onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)</li>
					</ul>

				<div id="directions">
					<h2>Directions</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>FOR THE CHILI: Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 teaspoon of the salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the ground chuck, stirring vigorously to separate the meat into individual strands. As soon as the foam from the meat rises to the top (this takes about 30 seconds) and before the water returns to a boil, drain the meat into a strainer and set it aside.</li>
						<li>Rinse and dry the empty saucepan. Set the pan over medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is warm, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and browned around the edges, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the chili powder, oregano, cocoa, cinnamon, cayenne, allspice, black pepper, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the broth, water, vinegar, sugar, and tomato sauce, scraping the pan bottom to remove any browned bits. </li>
						<li>Add the blanched ground beef and increase the heat to high. As soon as the liquid boils, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chili is deep red and has thickened slightly, about 1 hour. Adjust the seasonings, adding salt and hot pepper sauce to taste. (The chili can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat before serving.)</li>
						<li>TO SERVE: Divide the buttered spaghetti among individual bowls. Spoon the chili over the spaghetti and top with the cheese, beans, and onion. Serve immediately.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Notes</h2>
					<p>
						Choose a relatively plain tomato sauce-nothing too spicy or herbaceous. To warm the kidney beans, simmer them in water to cover for several minutes and then drain.
